# 0x02. Session authentication

## Background Context

In the industry, you should **not** implement your own Session authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: [Flask-HTTPAuth](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/_ZTQTaMKjx1S_xATshexkA)). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/uWXp4VcY3Dd9UzTtc9N5_A), without the help of Google:

### General

- What authentication means
- What session authentication means
- What Cookies are
- How to send Cookies
- How to parse Cookies

## Tasks

### 0. Et moi et moi et moi

Copy all your work of the 0x06. Basic authentication project in this new folder.

In this version, you implemented a Basic authentication for giving you access to all User endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/users`
- `POST /api/v1/users`
- `GET /api/v1/users/<user_id>`
- `PUT /api/v1/users/<user_id>`
- `DELETE /api/v1/users/<user_id>`

Now, you will add a new endpoint: `GET /users/me` to retrieve the authenticated `User` object.

- Copy folders `models` and `api` from the previous project `0x01. Basic authentication`
- Please make sure all mandatory tasks of this previous project are done at 100% because this project (and the rest of this track) will be based on it.
- Update `@app.before_request` in `api/v1/app.py`:
  - Assign the result of `auth.current_user(request)` to `request.current_user`
- Update method for the route `GET /api/v1/users/<user_id>` in `api/v1/views/users.py`:
  - If `<user_id>` is equal to `me` and `request.current_user` is `None`: `abort(404)`
  - If `<user_id>` is equal to `me` and `request.current_user` is not `None`: return the authenticated `User` in a JSON response (like a normal case of `GET /api/v1/users/<user_id>` where `<user_id>` is a valid `User` ID)
  - Otherwise, keep the same behavior

### Empty Session

Create a class `SessionAuth` that inherits from `Auth`. For the moment this class will be empty. It’s the first step for creating a new authentication mechanism:

- validate if everything inherits correctly without any overloading
- validate the “switch” by using environment variables

Update `api/v1/app.py` for using `SessionAuth` instance for the variable `auth` depending of the value of the environment variable `AUTH_TYPE`, If `AUTH_TYPE` is equal to `session_auth`:

- import `SessionAuth` from `api.v1.auth.session_auth`
- create an instance of `SessionAuth` and assign it to the variable `auth`

Otherwise, keep the previous mechanism.

### 2. Create a session

Update `SessionAuth` class:

- Create a class attribute `user_id_by_session_id` initialized by an empty dictionary
- Create an instance method `def create_session(self, user_id: str = None) -> str:` that creates a Session ID for a `user_id`:
  - Return `None` if `user_id` is `None`
  - Return `None` if `user_id` is not a string
  - Otherwise:
    - Generate a Session ID using `uuid` module and `uuid4()` like `id` in `Base`
    - Use this Session ID as key of the dictionary `user_id_by_session_id` - the value for this key must be `user_id`
    - Return the Session ID
  - The same `user_id` can have multiple Session ID - indeed, the `user_id` is the value in the dictionary `user_id_by_session_id`

Now you an “in-memory” Session ID storing. You will be able to retrieve an `User` id based on a Session ID.

### 3. User ID for Session ID

Update `SessionAuth` class:

Create an instance method `def user_id_for_session_id(self, session_id: str = None) -> str:` that returns a `User` ID based on a Session ID:

- Return `None` if `session_id` is `None`
- Return `None` if `session_id` is not a string
- Return the value (the `User` ID) for the key `session_id` in the dictionary `user_id_by_session_id`.
- You must use `.get()` built-in for accessing in a dictionary a value based on key

Now you have 2 methods (`create_session` and `user_id_for_session_id`) for storing and retrieving a link between a `User` ID and a Session ID.

### 4. Session cookie

Update `api/v1/auth/auth.py` by adding the method `def session_cookie(self, request=None):` that returns a cookie value from a request:

- Return `None` if `request` is `None`
- Return the value of the cookie `named _my_session_id` from `request` - the name of the cookie must be defined by the environment variable `SESSION_NAME`
- You must use `.get()` built-in for accessing the cookie in the request cookies dictionary
- You must use the environment variable `SESSION_NAME` to define the name of the cookie used for the Session ID

### 5. Before request

Update the `@app.before_request` method in `api/v1/app.py`:

- Add the URL path `/api/v1/auth_session/login/` in the list of excluded paths of the method `require_auth` - this route doesn’t exist yet but it should be accessible outside authentication
- If `auth.authorization_header(request)` and `auth.session_cookie(request)` return `None`, `abort(401)`

### 6. Use Session ID for identifying a User

Update `SessionAuth` class:

Create an instance method `def current_user(self, request=None):` (overload) that returns a `User` instance based on a cookie value:

- You must use `self.session_cookie(...)` and `self.user_id_for_session_id(...)` to return the `User` ID based on the cookie `_my_session_id`
- By using this `User` ID, you will be able to retrieve a `User` instance from the database - you can use `User.get(...)` for retrieving a `User` from the database.

Now, you will be able to get a `User` based on his session ID.

### 7. New view for Session Authentication

Create a new Flask view that handles all routes for the Session authentication.

In the file `api/v1/views/session_auth.py`, create a route `POST /auth_session/login` (= `POST /api/v1/auth_session/login`):

- Slash tolerant (`/auth_session/login` == `/auth_session/login/`)
- You must use `request.form.get()` to retrieve `email` and `password` parameters
- If `email` is missing or empty, return the JSON `{ "error": "email missing" }` with the status code `400`
- If `password` is missing or empty, return the JSON `{ "error": "password missing" }` with the status code `400`
- Retrieve the `User` instance based on the `email` - you must use the class method `search` of `User` (same as the one used for the `BasicAuth`)
  - If no `User` found, return the JSON `{ "error": "no user found for this email" }` with the status code `404`
  - If the `password` is not the one of the `User` found, return the JSON `{ "error": "wrong password" }` with the status code `401` - you must use `is_valid_password` from the `User` instance
  - Otherwise, create a Session ID for the `User` ID:
    - You must use `from api.v1.app import auth` - **WARNING: please import it only where you need it** - not on top of the file (can generate circular import - and break first tasks of this project)
      - You must use `auth.create_session(..)` for creating a Session ID
      - Return the dictionary representation of the `User` - you must use `to_json()` method from `User`
    - You must set the cookie to the response - you must use the value of the environment variable `SESSION_NAME` as cookie name - [tip](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/3WDlzYbVvdJJAf70IjWK6g)

In the file `api/v1/views/__init__.py`, you must add this new view at the end of the file.

### 8. Logout

Update the class `SessionAuth` by adding a new method `def destroy_session(self, request=None):` that deletes the user session / logout:

- If the `request` is equal to `None`, return `False`
- If the `request` doesn’t contain the Session ID cookie, return `False` - you must use `self.session_cookie(request)`
- If the Session ID of the `request` is not linked to any `User` ID, return `False` - you must use `self.user_id_for_session_id(...)`
- Otherwise, delete in `self.user_id_by_session_id` the Session ID (as key of this dictionary) and return `True`

Update the file `api/v1/views/session_auth.py`, by adding a new route `DELETE /api/v1/auth_session/logout`:

- Slash tolerant
- You must use `from api.v1.app import auth`
- You must use `auth.destroy_session(request)` for deleting the Session ID contains in the request as cookie:
  - If `destroy_session` returns `False`, `abort(404)`
  - Otherwise, return an empty JSON dictionary with the status code 200
